> Please do note that this project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for serious production use. It basically works but use it at your own risk.

## API Keys

ChatGPT requires an API key to work. You can get one by accessing Open AI dashboard at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Once you have your API key, you can save it to the database from WordPress admin panel.

## Basic Usage

To access the AI features, you can use the following shortcuts in the Gutenberg editor:

-   `CMD + .` to open the AI modal. (Windows equivalent: `CTRL + .`)
